## **üîßPROTECTING YOUR DATA**

#### **Step 1: From within VSCode in the root project directory, we will create a .gitignore file**

# For Mac Users
```js 
touch .gitignore 
```

# For Windows Users:

```js 
ni .gitignore 
```

#### Step 2: commit that .gitignore file (this prevents your sensitive information from being shown to others). **‚ö†Ô∏èDO NOT PROCEED UNTIL YOU DO!‚ö†Ô∏è**

![setup](https://coding-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/entity-readme-image.png "Set up instructions")

#### Step 3: **To commit your .gitignore file enter the following commands**

```js
git add .gitignore
```
```js
git commit -m "protect data"
```

#### Step 4: **Then, you need to update your username and password in the appsettings.json file.**

_by default these are set to user:root and an empty password. if you are unsure, refer to the settings for your MySqlWorkbench._
